Socket Library Hints

Review the socket library documentation here

Https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html
import socket: Enhances your script with socket communication capabilities. This line needs to be at
the top of your script to make sure it can be used.

Get Hostname

import socket
>>> socket.gethostname()

>>> hostname = socket.gethostname()

>>> socket.gethostbyname(hostname)

'172.20.10.4'

>>> socket.gethostbyname('localhost')
'127.0.0.1'



Get address family and socket address from string


import socket
import sys


try:
    for res in socket.getaddrinfo(sys.argv[1], None,
                                  proto=socket.IPPROTO_TCP):
        family = res[0]
        sockaddr = res[4]
        print(family, sockaddr)
except socket.gaierror:
    print("Invalid")
